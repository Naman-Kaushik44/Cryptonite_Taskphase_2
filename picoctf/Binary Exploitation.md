# Format String 0


**Flag**= `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_a1d85b3e}`
This challenge required us to use knowledge on format specifiers to get the flag.
One of the hints on this challenge encouraged me to look up info about format specifiers.
I found out that these are commonly used placeholders for data input and output in functions like scanf and printf in languages like C and C++.
``%s, %d, %x, %p`` etc. are some examples.
They generally begin with % symbol which is used to indicate them being a format specifier.
Exploitation on these can be done through leaking the data from stacks and by repeatedly giving format specifiers like these, an attacker can read things from the stack which includes addresses and variables.
So with this knowledge I went ahead and started the challenge in my webshell terminal on picoCTF.
Each time, I just selected the option with % in it and arrived at the flag pretty easily.

```bash
Sylvaris-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 55232

# Cookies

**Flag** = `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

So I have prior experience in web exploitation from a bit during other CTFs like OASIS challenge. According to the cookies challenge, we had to figure out the best cookie on the website `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/`.
My first approach was inspecting the elements of the page, where I went to the application tab and expanded on the cookies section.

There was only one cookie by the name of name and I noticed I could change it's values. 
So I started putting in different values and refreshing the page which changed the page by a bit every time.
The results were like this :
Always followed by the message `That is a cookie! Not very special though...`

I put in a big value like 30 after trying until value 4 which made the page go back to default so coming down from there and with some hit and trial, I got the hidden flag at the value of 18.
This is what the page looked like with the flag on it

I learnt that we can exploit cookies to find out hidden vulnerabilities in the website, it also requires a lot of patience to get it right.

# Cookies

**Flag** = `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

So I have prior experience in web exploitation from a bit during other CTFs like OASIS challenge. According to the cookies challenge, we had to figure out the best cookie on the website `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/`.
My first approach was inspecting the elements of the page, where I went to the application tab and expanded on the cookies section.

There was only one cookie by the name of name and I noticed I could change it's values. 
So I started putting in different values and refreshing the page which changed the page by a bit every time.
The results were like this :
Always followed by the message `That is a cookie! Not very special though...`

I put in a big value like 30 after trying until value 4 which made the page go back to default so coming down from there and with some hit and trial, I got the hidden flag at the value of 18.
This is what the page looked like with the flag on it

I learnt that we can exploit cookies to find out hidden vulnerabilities in the website, it also requires a lot of patience to get it right.

# Forbidden Path 

**Flag** = `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`

```Challenge Description
Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
```
The challenge required us to get past a filter that was filtering out absolute paths and read the flag.
After launching the challenge instance, a website link is given that opens to this: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6329234b-f8aa-4e4a-8657-b3809f283072)

Now in linux every directory has two implicit entries that we can reference in paths: `.` and `..` .
To bypass the filter of absolute path, I just used relative path method to open the file, we already were given the path to dive into i.e. ``/usr/share/nginx/html/`` which I did by using ../ four times to signify each step in the path to the file.
Hence entering ``../../../../flag.txt`` into the blank box redirected me to the page with the flag.

Incorrect methods I used:

I tried using `.` instead of `..` for the referencing. Unlike `..` which refers to the parent directory, `.` refers to the same directory so writing ``././././flag.txt`` was the same as writing /challenge which was wrong and got filtered out.
